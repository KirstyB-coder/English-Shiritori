# English-Shiritori
Python based English language shiritori game.
Shiritori is a vocabulary based game.
This is a single player version.
The computer generates an initial word to start play. 
The initial word is chosen randomly from a list of ten words.
The user is prompted to input words one at a time.
The words should make a chain, where the first letter of the word in play is the same as the last letter of the previous word.
  For example: star > rose > elephant > title
The user cannot use the same word twice, if they do they will be told the word has already been used and be prompted to enter a new word.
The game ends when the user loses by entering a word that does not start with the last letter of the previous word.
The game will then tell the user how many words they succesffuly played.
